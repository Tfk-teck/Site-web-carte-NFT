### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
I have some basics in web dev, but this challenge was a good opportunity to practice and bring my knowledge to reality. What was difficult is to adjust the size of an image ðŸ–¼ in the footer. I also learned how to use some new pseudo-classes like ::before.
